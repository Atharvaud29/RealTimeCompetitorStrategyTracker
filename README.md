## Project Statement:
This project focuses on creating a real-time competitive intelligence tool for
e-commerce businesses using LLMs like OpenAI GPT, Meta LLaMA, and machine
learning technologies. The system will monitor competitor pricing, discount
strategies, and customer sentiment across various e-commerce platforms. By
integrating and scraping data from multiple sources such as e-commerce and
listing sites, it will generate strategic insights and recommend responsive actions
to optimize pricing and promotions based on competitor trends. The solution
aims to provide e-commerce teams with actionable, data-driven strategies to
maintain a competitive edge in the fast-paced online retail environment.


## Outcomes:
● Real-time detection and analysis of competitor strategies and market trends.

● Sentiment analysis of customer feedback on competitor products.

● Actionable insights and adaptive strategy recommendations for e-commerce teams.

● Improved pricing and promotion strategies based on competitive intelligence.
